# MES DASHBOARD Overview
This Manufacturing Execution System (MES) project is built using Vue.js for the frontend and Express.js with TypeScript for the backend, connected to PostgreSQL for data management. The system features a dashboard that provides real-time insights into production and quality control processes. Users can manage production data, track product statuses from raw materials to finished goods, and conduct quality inspections. It supports full CRUD functionality, data export as CSV, and visualizes key metrics such as production status, machine utilization, and defect rates.

# Make sure Node.js is installed

Run the following to create table after database created
Create Table:

 ```bash
CREATE TABLE production (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    material VARCHAR(255)
);
 ```

 ```bash
CREATE TABLE quality_control (
    inspection_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     -- Auto-incrementing primary key
    product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,          -- Product ID, assuming it references a product table
    inspection_date DATE NOT NULL,        -- Date when the inspection was conducted
    result VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,          -- Result of the inspection (e.g., Passed, Failed)
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(), -- Timestamp when the record was created
    scheduled_date DATE NOT NULL          -- Date when the inspection was scheduled
);
 ```
